<para id="fs-idm26748320">Does aspirin reduce the risk of heart attacks? Is one brand of fertilizer more effective at growing roses than another? Is fatigue as dangerous to a driver as the influence of alcohol? Questions like these are answered using randomized experiments. In this module, you will learn important aspects of experimental design. Proper study design ensures the production of reliable, accurate data.</para>

<para id="fs-idm23516688">The purpose of an experiment is to investigate the relationship between two variables. When one variable causes change in another, we call the first variable the <term id="term-00001">independent variable</term> or <term id="term-00002">explanatory variable</term>. The affected variable is called the <term id="term-00003">dependent variable</term> or <term id="term-00004">response variable</term>: stimulus, response. In a randomized experiment, the researcher manipulates values of the explanatory variable and measures the resulting changes in the response variable. The different values of the explanatory variable are called <term id="term-00005">treatments</term>. An <term id="term-00006">experimental unit</term> is a single object or individual to be measured.</para><para id="fs-idp20958864">You want to investigate the effectiveness of vitamin E in preventing disease. You recruit a group of subjects and ask them if they regularly take vitamin E. You notice that the subjects who take vitamin E exhibit better health on average than those who do not. Does this prove that vitamin E is effective in disease prevention? It does not. There are many differences between the two groups compared in addition to vitamin E consumption. People who take vitamin E regularly often take other steps to improve their health: exercise, diet, other vitamin supplements, choosing not to smoke. Any one of these factors could be influencing health. As described, this study does not prove that vitamin E is the key to disease prevention.</para><para id="fs-idm26816896">Additional variables that can cloud a study are called <term id="term-00007">lurking variables</term>. In order to prove that the explanatory variable is causing a change in the response variable, it is necessary to isolate the explanatory variable. The researcher must design her experiment in such a way that there is only one difference between groups being compared: the planned treatments. This is accomplished by the <term id="term-00008">random assignment</term> of experimental units to treatment groups. When subjects are assigned treatments randomly, all of the potential lurking variables are spread equally among the groups. At this point the only difference between groups is the one imposed by the researcher. Different outcomes measured in the response variable, therefore, must be a direct result of the different treatments. In this way, an experiment can prove a cause-and-effect connection between the explanatory and response variables.</para><para id="fs-idm40990544">The power of suggestion can have an important influence on the outcome of an experiment. Studies have shown that the expectation of the study participant can be as important as the actual medication. In one study of performance-enhancing drugs, researchers noted:</para><para id="eip-753"><emphasis effect="italics">Results showed that believing one had taken the substance resulted in [</emphasis>performance<emphasis effect="italics">] times almost as fast as those associated with consuming the drug itself. In contrast, taking the drug without knowledge yielded no significant performance increment.</emphasis> (McClung, M. Collins, D. “Because I know it will!”: placebo effects of an ergogenic aid on athletic performance. Journal of Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology. 2007 Jun. 29(3):382-94. Web. April 30, 2013.)</para><para id="fs-idp21694240">When participation in a study prompts a physical response from a participant, it is difficult to isolate the effects of the explanatory variable. To counter the power of suggestion, researchers set aside one treatment group as a <term id="term-00009">control group</term>. This group is given a <term id="term-00010">placebo</term> treatment–a treatment that cannot influence the response variable. The control group helps researchers balance the effects of being in an experiment with the effects of the active treatments. Of course, if you are participating in a study and you know that you are receiving a pill which contains no actual medication, then the power of suggestion is no longer a factor. <term id="term-00011">Blinding</term> or masking in a randomized experiment preserves the power of suggestion. When a person involved in a research study is blinded, they don't know who is receiving the active treatment(s) and who is receiving the placebo treatment. A <term id="term-00012">double-blind experiment</term> is one in which both the subjects and the researchers involved with the subjects are blinded.</para><example id="fs-idp16610496">

<para id="fs-idp39070944">The Smell &amp; Taste Treatment and Research Foundation conducted a study to investigate whether smell can affect learning. Subjects completed mazes multiple times while wearing masks. They completed the pencil and paper mazes three times wearing floral-scented masks, and three times with unscented masks. Participants were assigned at random to wear the floral mask during the first three trials or during the last three trials. For each trial, researchers recorded the time it took to complete the maze and the subject’s impression of the mask’s scent: positive, negative, or neutral.

<title>Chapter Review</title>
<para id="fs-idm59870208">A poorly designed study will not produce reliable data. There are certain key components that must be
included in every experiment. To eliminate lurking variables, subjects must be assigned randomly to different treatment groups. One of the groups must act as a control group, demonstrating what happens when the active treatment is not applied. Participants in the control group receive a placebo treatment that looks exactly like the active treatments but cannot influence the response variable. To preserve the integrity of the placebo, both researchers and subjects may be blinded. When a study is designed properly, the only difference between treatment groups is the one imposed by the researcher. Therefore, when groups respond differently to different treatments, the difference must be due to the influence of the explanatory variable.</para><para id="eip-126">“An ethics problem arises when you are considering an action that benefits you or some cause you support, hurts or reduces benefits to others, and violates some rule.” (Andrew Gelman, “Open Data and Open Methods,” Ethics and Statistics, http://www.stat.columbia.edu/~gelman/research/published/ChanceEthics1.pdf (accessed May 1, 2013).) Ethical violations in statistics are not always easy to spot. Professional associations and federal agencies post guidelines for proper conduct. It is important that you learn basic statistical procedures so that you can recognize proper data analysis.</para></section>
