  <para id="fs-idm27402752">Earlier, we discussed sampling distributions. Particular distributions are associated with hypothesis testing.We will perform hypotheses tests of a population mean using a <term class="no-emphasis">normal distribution</term> or a <term class="no-emphasis">Student's <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>-distribution</term>. (Remember, use a Student's <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>-distribution when the population <term class="no-emphasis">standard deviation</term> is unknown and the sample size is small, where small is considered to be less than 30 observations.) We perform tests of a population proportion using a normal distribution when we can assume that the distribution is normally distributed. We consider this  to be true if the sample proportion, <m:math><m:mi>p</m:mi><m:mo>'</m:mo></m:math>, times the sample size is greater than 5 and 1-<m:math><m:mi>p</m:mi><m:mo>'</m:mo></m:math> times the sample size is also greater than 5.

</table><para id="eip-771">This rule will always be the same no matter what hypothesis we are testing or what formulas we are using to make the test. The only change will be to change the Z<sub>c</sub> to the appropriate symbol for the test statistic for the parameter being tested. Stating the decision rule another way: if the sample mean is unlikely to have come from the distribution with the hypothesized mean we cannot accept the null hypothesis. Here we define "unlikely" as having a probability less than alpha of occurring.</para></section><section id="fs-idm257750672"><title>P-Value Approach</title><para id="eip-470">An alternative decision rule can be developed by calculating the probability that a sample mean could be found that would give a test statistic larger than the test statistic found from the current sample data assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Here the notion of "likely" and "unlikely" is defined by the probability of drawing a sample with a mean from a population with the hypothesized mean that is either larger or smaller than that found in the sample data. Simply stated, the p-value approach compares the desired significance level, α, to the p-value which is the probability of drawing a sample mean further from the hypothesized value than the actual sample mean. A large <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value calculated from the data indicates that we should not reject the <term>null hypothesis</term>. The smaller the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value, the more unlikely the outcome, and the stronger the evidence is against the null hypothesis. We would reject the null hypothesis if the evidence is strongly against it. The relationship between the decision rule of comparing the calculated test statistics, Z<sub>c</sub>, and the Critical Value, Z<sub>α</sub> , and using the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value can be seen in <link target-id="eip-id1169346631895"/>.</para><figure id="eip-id1169346631895"><media id="eip-id1169348081431" alt="...">

        </figure><para id="eip-872">The calculated value of the test statistic is Z<sub>c</sub> in this example and is marked on the bottom graph of the standard normal distribution because it is a Z value. In this case the calculated value is in the tail and thus we cannot accept the null hypothesis, the associated <m:math><m:mover><m:mi>X</m:mi><m:mo>–</m:mo></m:mover></m:math> is just too unusually large to believe that it came from the distribution with a mean of µ<sub>0</sub> with a significance level of α.  </para><para id="eip-15">If we use the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value decision rule we need one more step. We need to find in the standard normal table the probability associated with the calculated test statistic, Z<sub>c</sub>. We then compare that to the α associated with our selected level of confidence.  In <link target-id="eip-id1169346631895"/> we see that the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value is less than α and therefore we cannot accept the null. We know that the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value is less than α because the area under the p-value is smaller than α/2. It is important to note that two researchers drawing randomly from the same population may find two different P-values from their samples. This occurs because the P-value is calculated as the probability in the tail beyond the sample mean assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. Because the sample means will in all likelihood be different this will create two different P-values. Nevertheless, the conclusions as to the null hypothesis should be different with only the level of probability of α.  </para><para id="eip-825">Here is a systematic way to make a decision of whether you cannot accept or cannot reject a null <emphasis>hypothesis</emphasis> if using the <term><emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value</term> and a <term>preset or preconceived α</term> (the "<term>significance level</term>"). A preset <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis> is the probability of a <term>Type I</term> error (rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true). It may or may not be given to you at the beginning of the problem. In any case, the value of α is the decision of the analyst. When you make a decision to reject or not reject <emphasis effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></emphasis>, do as follows:</para><list id="eip-526"><item>If α &gt; <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value, cannot accept <emphasis effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></emphasis>.

There is sufficient evidence to conclude that <emphasis effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></emphasis> is an incorrect belief and that the <term>alternative hypothesis</term>,  <emphasis effect="italics">H<sub>a</sub></emphasis>, may be correct.</item>
<item>If α ≤ <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value, cannot reject <emphasis effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></emphasis>. The results of the sample data are not significant.

<item>When you "cannot reject <emphasis effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></emphasis>", it does not mean that you should believe that <emphasis effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></emphasis> is true. It simply means that the sample data have <emphasis>failed</emphasis> to provide sufficient evidence to cast serious doubt about the truthfulness of <emphasis effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></emphasis>. Remember that the null is the status quo and it takes high probability to overthrow the status quo.  This bias in favor of the null hypothesis is what gives rise to the statement "tyranny of the status quo" when discussing hypothesis testing and the scientific method.</item>

This was called a two-tailed test because the alternative hypothesis allowed that the mean could have come from a population which was either larger or smaller than the hypothesized mean in the null hypothesis. This could be seen by the statement of the alternative hypothesis as μ ≠ 100, in this example.
</para><para id="eip-725">It may be that the analyst has no concern about the value being "too" high or "too" low from the hypothesized value. If this is the case, it becomes a one-tailed test and all of the alpha probability is placed in just one tail and not split into α/2 as in the above case of a two-tailed test. Any test of a claim will be a one-tailed test. For example, a car manufacturer claims that their Model 17B provides gas mileage of greater than 25 miles per gallon.

This is because failing to reject the null, the status quo, must be accomplished with 90 or 95 percent confidence that it cannot be maintained.
