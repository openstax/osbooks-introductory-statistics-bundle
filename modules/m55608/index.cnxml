<section id="fs-idm257750672"><title>P-Value Approach</title><para id="eip-470">An alternative decision rule can be developed by calculating the probability that a sample mean could be found that would give a test statistic larger than the test statistic found from the current sample data assuming that the null hypothesis is true. Here the notion of "likely" and "unlikely" is defined by the probability of drawing a sample with a mean from a population with the hypothesized mean that is either larger or smaller than that found in the sample data. Simply stated, the p-value approach compares the desired significance level, α, to the p-value which is the probability of drawing a sample mean further from the hypothesized value than the actual sample mean. A large <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value calculated from the data indicates that we should not reject the <term id="term-00006">null hypothesis</term>. The smaller the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value, the more unlikely the outcome, and the stronger the evidence is against the null hypothesis. We would reject the null hypothesis if the evidence is strongly against it. The relationship between the decision rule of comparing the calculated test statistics, Z<sub>c</sub>, and the Critical Value, Z<sub>α</sub> , and using the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value can be seen in <link target-id="eip-id1169346631895"/>.</para><figure id="eip-id1169346631895"><media id="eip-id1169348081431" alt="...">

In this case the calculated value is in the tail and thus we cannot accept the null hypothesis, the associated <m:math><m:mover accent="true"><m:mi>X</m:mi><m:mo>¯</m:mo></m:mover></m:math> is just too unusually large to believe that it came from the distribution with a mean of µ<sub>0</sub> with a significance level of α.  </para><para id="eip-15">If we use the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value decision rule we need one more step.

In <link target-id="eip-id1169346631895"/> we see that the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value is less than α and therefore we cannot accept the null. We know that the <emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value is less than α because the area under the p-value is smaller than α/2. It is important to note that two researchers drawing randomly from the same population may find two different P-values from their samples. This occurs because the P-value is calculated as the probability in the tail beyond the sample mean assuming that the null hypothesis is correct. Because the sample means will in all likelihood be different this will create two different P-values. Nevertheless, the conclusions as to the null hypothesis should be different with only the level of probability of α.  </para><para id="eip-825">Here is a systematic way to make a decision of whether you cannot accept or cannot reject a null <emphasis>hypothesis</emphasis> if using the <term id="term-00007"><emphasis effect="italics">p</emphasis>-value</term> and a <term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00008">preset or preconceived α</term> (the "<term class="no-emphasis" id="term-00009">significance level</term>"). A preset <emphasis effect="italics">α</emphasis> is the probability of a <term id="term-00010">Type I</term> error (rejecting the null hypothesis when the null hypothesis is true). It may or may not be given to you at the beginning of the problem. In any case, the value of α is the decision of the analyst.

<item>When you "cannot reject <emphasis effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></emphasis>", it does not mean that you should believe that <emphasis effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></emphasis> is true. It simply means that the sample data have <emphasis>failed</emphasis> to provide sufficient evidence to cast serious doubt about the truthfulness of <emphasis effect="italics">H<sub>0</sub></emphasis>.

This was called a two-tailed test because the alternative hypothesis allowed that the mean could have come from a population which was either larger or smaller than the hypothesized mean in the null hypothesis.

</para><para id="eip-725">It may be that the analyst has no concern about the value being "too" high or "too" low from the hypothesized value. If this is the case, it becomes a one-tailed test and all of the alpha probability is placed in just one tail and not split into α/2 as in the above case of a two-tailed test. Any test of a claim will be a one-tailed test. For example, a car manufacturer claims that their Model 17B provides gas mileage of greater than 25 miles per gallon.

Namely: If the population standard deviation is unknown, and the sample size is less than 30, substitute s, the point estimate for the population standard deviation, σ, in the formula for the test statistic and use the student's <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>-distribution. All the formulas and figures above are unchanged except for this substitution and changing the Z distribution to the student's <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>-distribution on the graph. Remember that the student's <emphasis effect="italics">t</emphasis>-distribution can only be computed knowing the proper degrees of freedom for the problem. In this case, the degrees of freedom is computed as before with confidence intervals: df = (n-1). The calculated t-value is compared to the t-value associated with the pre-set level of confidence required in the test, t<sub>α</sub>, <sub>df</sub> found in the student's t tables. If we do not know σ, but the sample size is 30 or more, we simply substitute s for σ and use the normal distribution.
