<title>Chapter Objectives</title>
<para id="element-382">By the end of this chapter, the student should be able to:</para>
<list id="element-22" list-type="bulleted">
<item>Discuss basic ideas of linear regression and correlation.</item>
<item>Create and interpret a line of best fit.</item>
<item>Calculate and interpret the correlation coefficient.</item>
<item>Calculate and interpret outliers.</item></list>
</note>
<para id="element-3817">Professionals often want to know how two or more numeric variables are related. For example, is there a relationship between the grade on the second math exam a student takes and the grade on the final exam? If there is a relationship, what is the relationship and how strong is it?</para>
<para id="element-814">In another example, your income may be determined by your education, your profession, your years of experience, and your ability. The amount you pay a repair person for labor is often determined by an initial amount plus an hourly fee.</para>
<para id="element-363">The type of data described in the examples is <term id="term-00001">bivariate</term> data — "bi" for two variables. In reality, statisticians use <term id="term-00002">multivariate</term> data, meaning many variables.</para><para id="element-601">In this chapter, you will be studying the simplest form of regression, "linear regression" with one independent variable (<emphasis effect="italics">x</emphasis>). This involves data that fits a line in two dimensions. You will also study correlation which measures how strong the relationship is.</para>
